Mr and Mrs Hamilton had two sons, Richard and Philip, who were both taller and friendlier than me. My parents liked them a lot. ‘Why can’t you be more like Richard and Philip?’ I hated them.Do the preparation task first. Then read the story and do the exercise.ExerciseEvery August. Every August for twelve years. Every August for twelve years we went to the same small town on holiday. Every August for twelve years we went to the same beach. Every August for twelve years my parents rented the same small house in the same small town near the same beach, so every morning of every August for twelve years I woke up and walked down to the same beach and sat under the same umbrella or on the same towel in front of the same sea.There was a small café on the beach where we sat every day, and every day Mr Morelli in the café said ‘Good morning!’ to my parents, and then always patted me on the head like a dog. Every day we walked down to our red and white umbrella. Every day my father sat on his deckchair and read the newspaper then went to sleep. Every day my mother went for a swim in the sea and then went to sleep. Every lunchtime we ate the same cheese sandwiches which my mother made, and then every afternoon we went up to the café and ate an ice cream while my parents talked to Mr Morelli about the weather. Every summer for twelve years I sat there and read books and sometimes played volleyball with some of the other boys and girls who were there, but I never made any friends.It was so boring.Every August for twelve years the same family sat next to us. They were called the Hamiltons. We had a red and white umbrella, they had a green one. Every morning my parents said ‘Good morning!’ to Mr and Mrs Hamilton, and Mr and Mrs Hamilton said ‘Good morning!’ to my parents. Sometimes they talked about the weather.Mr and Mrs Hamilton had two sons. Richard was the same age as me, and his brother Philip was two years older than me. Richard and Philip were both taller than me. Richard and Philip were very friendly and both very handsome. They were much friendlier and more handsome than me. They made friends with everyone and organised the games of volleyball on the beach or swimming races in the sea with the other children. They always won the games of volleyball and the swimming races. My parents liked Richard and Philip a lot. ‘Why can’t you be more like Richard and Philip?’ they said to me. ‘Look at them! They make friends with everyone! They are polite, good boys! You just sit here reading books and doing nothing!’I, of course, hated them.Richard and Philip, Richard and Philip, Richard and Philip – it was all I ever heard from my parents every August for twelve years. Richard and Philip were perfect. Everything about them was better than anything about me. Even their green beach umbrella was better than our red and white one.I was sixteen years old the last summer we went there. Perfect Richard and perfect Philip came to the beach one day and said that they were going to have a barbecue at lunchtime. They were going to cook for everyone! ‘Forget your cheese sandwiches,’ they laughed. ‘Come and have some hamburgers or barbecue chicken with us! We’re going to cook!’My parents, of course, thought this was wonderful. ‘Look at how good Richard and Philip are! They’re going to do a barbecue and they’ve invited everybody! You couldn’t organise a barbecue!’Every summer for twelve years, on the other side of my family, sat Mrs Moffat. Mrs Moffat was a very large woman who came to the same beach every summer for twelve years on her own. Nobody knew if she had a husband or a family, but my parents said that she was very rich. Mrs Moffat always came to the beach wearing a large hat, a pair of sunglasses and a gold necklace. She always carried a big bag with her. She never went swimming, but sat under her umbrella reading magazines until lunchtime when she went home.Richard and Philip, of course, also invited Mrs Moffat to their barbecue.Richard and Philip’s barbecue was, of course, a great success. About twenty people came, and Richard and Philip cooked lots of hamburgers and chicken and made a big salad and brought big pieces of watermelon and everyone laughed and joked and told Mr and Mrs Hamilton how wonderful their sons were. I ate one hamburger and didn’t talk to anybody. After a while, I left, and made sure that nobody saw me leave.Mrs Moffat ate three plates of chicken and two hamburgers. After that she said she was very tired and was going to go and have a sleep. She walked over to her umbrella and sat down on her deckchair and went to sleep. When she woke up later, everybody on the beach was surprised to hear her screaming and shouting.‘My bag!!!! My bag!!!’ she shouted. ‘It’s gone!!! It’s GONE!!!’ Everybody on the beach ran over to Mrs Moffat to see what the problem was. ‘Someone has taken my bag!!!’ she screamed. ‘Someone has stolen my bag!!!’‘Impossible!’ said everybody else. ‘This is a very safe, friendly beach! There are no thieves here!’ But it was true. Mrs Moffat’s big bag wasn’t there any more.Nobody had seen any strangers on the beach during the barbecue, so they thought that Mrs Moffat had perhaps taken her bag somewhere and forgotten it. Mr Morelli from the café organised a search of the beach. Everybody looked everywhere for Mrs Moffat’s big bag.Eventually, they found it. My father saw it hidden in the sand under a deckchair. A green deckchair. Richard and Philip’s deckchair. My father took it and gave it back to Mrs Moffat. Everybody looked at Richard and Philip. Richard and Philip, the golden boys, stood there looking surprised. Of course, they didn’t know what to say.Mrs Moffat looked in her bag. She started screaming again. Her purse with her money in it wasn’t in the big bag. ‘My purse!’ she shouted, ‘My purse has gone! Those boys have stolen it! They organised a barbecue so they could steal my purse!’Everybody tried to explain to Mrs Moffat that this couldn’t possibly be true, but Mrs Moffat called the police. The police arrived and asked golden Richard and golden Philip lots of questions. Richard and Philip couldn’t answer the questions. Eventually, they all got into a police car and drove away to the police station.I sat there, pretending to read my book and trying to hide a big, fat purse under the sand on the beach.That was the last summer we went to the beach. My parents never talked about Richard and Philip again.Chris RoseExerciseHow do you think the narrator will feel about what he did ten years later?

 
Washington replied on 17 August, 2020 - 23:01 Brazil    I read the comments and almost everyone, like me, think in the same way, the narrator could not stand the sameness of the vacations, associated with comparisons made by his parents, comparisons of such bad taste that they humiliated his son, the narrator. Carried away by the hate and jalousie he harbored for the "golden boys" he make up the evil plan: stolen Mrs. Moffat's purse and waited for the result. The golden boys carried the blame.
The rest of the story everyone knows. The narrator and his parents didn't come back at that beach anymore.
As for the wrong done, I think the narrator did not feel guilty and after ten years he still doesn't have this kind of feeling.  His narrative don't show regrets.
This story didn't have a good end.

 
Justine._127 replied on 3 June, 2020 - 12:21 Germany    In my opinion it wasn't ok to hide the bag just because she is jealous of them. It isn't the fault from the Boys and they were always nice to her so i don't really understand why she is ding this. It's a good story, but this isn't a good Ending.. haha.. and when she is oder she will hate herself for that what she had done that day.

willis replied on 25 July, 2020 - 00:43 Italy    She think is a girl but i think he is a boy. If his father compares him to the golden boys, he too must be a boy.

 
Rafaela1 replied on 14 April, 2020 - 02:43 Cambodia    I feel sorry for "golden Richard and golden Phillip", because they were literally good kids, but became an object of the narrator's jealousy. This commonly happens in crime dramas. My grandma used to say that it was nonsese to compare yourself with others, because it's difficult to compare numerators with different denominators which has large variations. So I feel sorry for the narrator as well, because he fell victim to his mom's inferior complex. Although, moms sometimes admire other kids in front of their kids on purpose when they want to push their sweeties to grow.I hope the narrator will find the right people and right place to live in the future!

 
ghazala faraz replied on 13 April, 2020 - 19:17 Pakistan    it was the lessonable story, actually when parents compare their children with other ones, they lose their personality, self confidence. They get frustrate, feeling jealous,start hiding things from parents. They make the boundary between parents and own self. I remember that i was in school, when the teacher asked any question in classroom, i did not have much confidence that i  could raise hand and give him answer even i knew the answer. So, appreciate your childrens in small things or achievements, show them you have proud on them like parents show or point out the negative points of the children,  likewise highlight the positive side of childrens.

 
Pcarla replied on 8 April, 2020 - 17:41 Cameroon    I love this wonderful story. The moral of this story is parents must not compare children. They must stop putting their children down. Every child need support of their parents to improve themselve. I don't agree with the narrator but he has  had the behavior of the frustrated child by their own parents.
of course, the narrator will regret his behavior later because it is not a good behavoir to adopt by someone.// every time I read "golden Richard and golden Phillip" it is very funny for me and I laughted very much.

 
parisaach replied on 29 July, 2019 - 08:18 Iran    I hate the narrator. He was so jelous and wicked, he should ashame of himslef  not ten years later but as soon as he did the shameful thing to those two poor boys. But I expect something like that happened, when I read the story I've been waiting the narrator do something to hurt those golden boys.I hate these kind of people, the people who can't be perfect and hate successful people around them. I wish the story didn't finish like that. The narrator deserved a punishment. Actually I've never been perfect too. My parents never proud of me. They always said that other kids were better than me.The worse thing was they weren't better than me. None of those kids around me were so much good and handsome like Richard and Philip. But I am not a geleous person, and I hate hurt other people because of jealousy. Maybe it wasn't narrator's fault though I think  he is guilty, but his parents were more guilty. parents shouldn't compare the kids , It cause children lose their self confidence like me. I remember I've never talk at school even if I knew answer of a question I'd never said anything because I was afraid the  answer be wrong . I thought 'how could I know the answer while no othe student knows.'

Menglan replied on 29 November, 2018 - 04:04 China    Well, I didn’t expect the story to develop like this. The narrator's scheme achieved, he won't go to that beach again and his parents won't compare him with that two boys. However, after ten years, how will the life of the narrator develop? What will happen to his life next summer? I thought he will regret what he did. Because you will never know what will happen in the next second. Maybe when you are misunderstood as a thief, you will understand how abominable and unforgivable your previous actions are.
