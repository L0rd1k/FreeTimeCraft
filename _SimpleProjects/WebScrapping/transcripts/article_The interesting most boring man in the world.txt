Thierry didn’t know why people thought he was so boring. Thierry thought he was quite interesting. After all, he collected stamps. What could be more interesting than stamps? It was true that he didn’t have any other hobbies or interests, but that didn’t matter for Thierry. He had his job, after all. He had a very interesting job. At least, Thierry thought it was interesting. Everybody else said that his job was boring. But he was an accountant! Why do people think that accountants are boring? thought Thierry. Thierry thought his job was fascinating. Every day, he went to his office, switched on his computer and spent seven and a half hours looking at spreadsheets and moving numbers around on them. What could be more interesting than that?But Thierry was unhappy. He was unhappy because people thought he was boring. He didn’t want to be boring. He wanted people to think that he was a very interesting person. He tried to talk to people about his stamp collection. But every time he talked about his stamp collection he saw that people were bored. Because people were bored when he talked about his stamp collection, he talked about his job instead. He thought people would be very interested when he talked about his job, but, no, people thought his job was even more boring than his stamp collection. Sometimes, people even went to sleep when he talked to them.Thierry thought about how to make himself more interesting. He decided that he needed to be famous for something. He thought about his stamp collection and decided that perhaps his stamp collection could make him famous. Perhaps he had the biggest stamp collection in the world or perhaps he had a very valuable stamp. Yes, this was it, he decided.He wrote a letter to a local newspaper and asked them if they wanted to come and write an article about a local man with the biggest stamp collection in the world. The local newspaper wrote a letter back to Thierry telling him that actually the Queen of England had the biggest stamp collection in the world. Thierry was very sad to learn this, but wrote back to the newspaper, telling them that he thought he had the most valuable stamp in the world. The newspaper wrote back to him, telling him that the most valuable stamp in the world cost 2,240,000 dollars, and asking him if he was sure that he had it. Thierry wasn’t sure that he had it. In fact, he was sure that he didn’t have it. Perhaps his whole collection was very valuable though …‘Is it worth 10 million dollars?’ asked the man from the newspaper on the telephone when Thierry called him.‘Erm, no, I don’t think so …’‘Forget it then,’ said the man from the newspaper.Thierry thought about other things to make himself famous. Perhaps he could be the best accountant in the world! Yes, this was it, he decided. He told a friend that he was the best accountant in the world.‘How do you know?’ asked his friend.‘Well,’ said Thierry, ‘I have a good job, I like it … it’s very interesting … spreadsheets … numbers … taxes … finance …’ He saw his friend going to sleep. ‘Hmmm,’ he thought. ‘Perhaps I’m not the best or the most interesting accountant in the world.’‘Listen, Thierry,’ said his friend when he woke up again. ‘Perhaps you don’t have the biggest or the most valuable stamp collection in the world. Perhaps you aren’t the best or the most interesting accountant in the world. But there is one thing – Thierry, you are probably the most boring man in the world.’Yes! Of course! This was it. Thierry could be famous because he was the most boring man in the world. Now he saw that his friends were right. He phoned the newspaper again.‘Hello!’ he said. ‘Would you like to do an interview with the most boring man in the world?’‘The most boring man in the world?’ said the man from the newspaper. ‘Now that’s interesting!’Next week there was a big article in the newspaper. ‘The Most Boring Man in the World!’ There was a picture of Thierry in his office. There was a picture of Thierry with his stamp collection. There was an interview with Thierry and interviews with his friends. His friends said they went to sleep when Thierry talked about his job or his stamp collection.The next day the BBC and CNN called Thierry. They wanted stories about the most boring man in the world. ‘The most boring man in the world!’ they said. ‘That’s so interesting!’And so, finally, Thierry Boyle became the official Most Boring Man in the World. You won’t find his name in the Guinness World Records book, because they said that it was impossible to decide exactly how boring somebody is, but it was no problem for Thierry. Now he was famous. Now he was so boring that he was interesting.Chris RoseExerciseExercise

Dovydas Jasionis replied on 5 October, 2020 - 16:37 Lithuania    I really like the story "The most intresting boring man in the world". I really like this story, because I have never readed a story like this. This story is very intresting because, I like how Thierry tries his best to be intresting and to become famous. I like how Thierry stays positive and that he does not care what other people are saying about him and that he still thinks that he is very intresting, when for real he is not. And thing that I like the most about this story is that, one of his friends gets out of comfort zone and says that Thierry is really boring and I like that Thierry accepts that really calmly and that he find a way to turn the thing, that he is really boring into a good thing.

 
Domantas Baublys replied on 5 October, 2020 - 15:47 Lithuania    I think that this man is very self-confident, because he think's that he can be famous in the world for doing something he loves, which is collecting stamps and being an  accountant. Most people get famous in the world for doing something interesting or rather doing something that nobody else has ever done. But I do think that there are people definetly more boring than Thierry. Collecting stamps and being a accountant isn't even that bad! My Dad can sometimes be definetly more boring than Thierry because he always talks about the things him and his friends used to do back in the day. On a different note, this story is definetly interesting to read and is worth your time.

 
Nojus Aleksandr... replied on 4 October, 2020 - 11:37 Lithuania    The story of this man is really interesting. It really surprised me that no one was interested in his life, his work or his hobbies. I think someone was interested in listening to him talk about his work and hobbies. Personally, I think this story is interesting and worthy of attention, because there is not a single person in the world who is not mean and boring to anyone. I think that person should read this story.
  After reading this story, I can say that there are many more boring people than this man. It could be my grandfather, who is really bored than this man.

Rohit Bisen replied on 22 April, 2020 - 20:49 India    hi friends,
This is an really intreasting story. In this world each individual has the different-different types of talent, as a result no one can do that work better than that person who has the talent of the perticular work. For eg: Scahin Tendulkar he is one of the greate player of the cricket. how many cricketers are every year play cricket but the tag of great is only come in front of their name who has talent of the specific field. Talent is god gifted but its our responsibility to short out it. Most of time it become very difficult to find out our talent some time our friends helps us to identify our talent. If you identify your talent next step just follow your talent you will definitly become unique than others.for eg: If you have good voice and you love singing may be you will be a good singer, but if you r putting your all efforts in somewhere else you will might not get succes in other fields bez    your r become only for singing. so explore your talent, passion and just follow it don't bocome the part of crowed, become unique and more succesful than others....

 
ghazala faraz replied on 13 April, 2020 - 16:01 Pakistan    Ahhh, it was interesting boring man story, but this based on true facts, i remembered that when i was an accounting student, i used to go crazy when i could not solve any question, this was happened with two subjects ( Maths and accounting).  But when you keep step on the professional life, you have to change yourself according to the surrounding,  keep smile on your face, create a chill environment on the workplace, make happy to the people who belongs to u. I say with certainty you will famous in positive aspects.

 
cittàutopica replied on 24 March, 2020 - 14:18 Italy    I think this story provides a cross section of our age, because there were many  people who achieve celebrity without a real merit, taking as an example famous persons from the media.

 
parisaach replied on 31 July, 2019 - 06:04 Iran    I like the story, maybe it wasn't as interesting as other stories from  Chris Rose, but still it was still great. Actually I accept accounting is boring because though I educated in computer science, I work in accounting department of a bank, and I accept that accounting is really boring. I hate spreadsheets, they mostly work with excel which is the most  annoying software ever.
I thought Thierry never could have any friends, but suprisingly he had some friends, maybe they weren't his friends they were just his colleagues. I never can be friends with such a person for a long time.
