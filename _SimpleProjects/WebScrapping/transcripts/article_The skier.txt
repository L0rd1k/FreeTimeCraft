Afel was twelve years old when he saw them. ‘What are those?’ he asked his uncle excitedly. ‘Skis,’ replied his uncle. ‘And those people are called skiers.’ Afel was in love. He wanted to be a skier.Do the preparation task first. Then read the story and do the exercises.ExerciseAfel was only a very small boy when he first saw snow. But it wasn’t real snow that he saw. No, there was no real snow where he lived. He saw the snow in a picture book. The book had lots of pictures of children playing in big white fields. He asked his mother, ‘What are those white fields?’, and his mother laughed and said, ‘That’s snow!’ She tried to explain to him what snow was, but Afel didn’t really understand. Sometimes there was rain where he lived, but not very much, so it was very difficult for him to understand what this cold, ice rain that his mother described was. It didn’t matter. Even when he was only a very small boy, Afel was already in love with snow.He dreamed about snow all the time, trying to imagine how it really was. He thought of big white fields. He thought of the big, heavy clothes the children playing in the snow wore. He thought about feeling cold. He dreamed of being able to fly across the white fields of snow.Then, when Afel was twelve years old, the next thing happened. One day he was watching the TV at his uncle’s house. His uncle had a big, new TV, with all the satellite channels. Afel was watching one of the satellite channels and a programme came on, and the programme was full of snow. Lots and lots of it. And not only snow – there were people flying across the snow. They looked like strange animals, like fantastic birds. They had hats which covered all their heads and big goggles over their eyes. They wore brightly coloured clothes. And on their feet, they had things that looked like strange shoes.‘What are those?’ he asked his uncle excitedly.‘Skis,’ replied his uncle. ‘And those people are called skiers.’ Afel was in love. Here was the snow, and here were people who were flying across the snow. It was just like one of his dreams. It was perfect. At that moment, he decided. He wanted to be a skier.He asked his uncle what the programme was.‘The Winter Olympics,’ said his uncle. ‘It’s like the normal Olympics, but for sports where you need snow – skiing, ice skating, bobsleigh, those sorts of things. They have it every four years.’Afel found out that the next Winter Olympics was in Vancouver in Canada, in 2010.‘Perfect,’ he thought. ‘Enough time for me to become a brilliant skier. Then I’ll go to the Winter Olympics, and win the gold medal for skiing.’‘But there’s no snow here!’ people told him. ‘Where are you going to ski?’Afel didn’t care. He made himself a pair of skis from two pieces of wood. He tied them to his feet and practised skiing holding two sticks in his hands. At first he couldn’t move, but he practised and practised and practised until he could move quite quickly across the sand or the earth where he lived. He tried to fly down the hills like the people on TV, but he couldn’t. He could only move slowly.‘Never mind,’ he thought. ‘It’s a start ...’‘How will you go to the Olympics?’ people asked him. ‘Our country doesn’t even have a team that goes to the Winter Olympics. Why don’t you take up athletics instead? You don’t need lots of expensive equipment to practise. Our country is very good at athletics. We have lots of runners. And every time we win lots of medals at the Olympics. But no skiing, no.’Afel didn’t care. He found that Jamaica had sent a bobsleigh team to the Olympics a few years ago.‘If Jamaica has a bobsleigh team,’ he thought, ‘then our country can have a skier.’So every night, out in the middle of the desert, Afel now practises skiing down sand dunes. He dreams that the yellow sand and brown earth of the desert is the white, white snow of the mountains he saw on the television. He dreams that the yellow sand and brown earth are as gold as the medal he will bring home with him, when he is the world champion.Chris RoseExerciseExerciseHave you seen snow? 

 
TP replied on 23 October, 2019 - 13:42 Sri Lanka    Unfortunately, I have never seen snow. It never snows in my country. I really love go skiing one day. I thought I would never be able to do so. However, after reading this story, I think I will do it someday.

parisaach replied on 3 August, 2019 - 06:19 Iran    I like snow. In my city we don't have much snow, but in some other cities in my country there is lots of snow in winters. When I was a child things were different, we had snowy winters in our city, sometimes our school were closed because of snow and it made me so happy. We went on the roof of our house made snowman, and threw snowballs on each other. At nights my father came home and we went on the roof and shoveled snow off of our roof then we went on room and all sat around a special wooden table which is called 'korsi' that was  covered with a big and cozy blanket and we threw some matteres all four side of Korsi.  We slept on the matresses at night while we were covered with that big blanket. there was a special  metallic container with ashes that were burned on it and it  warmed the space under the Korsi.
It sounds it was about a thousands years ago. Time flies. Now winters are not that cold. maybe it snows once or twice at year. people are not so closed as before. We are all in our seperate world though we still live together.

This short story teaches us how we should always do. Set the goal and reach it no matter what.
We have very snowy winters in Russia. Sometimes we say, that we have 9 months of winter in a year. But thanks to this fact, we have a lot of winter activities, including skiing. I like mountain skiing, it's indescribable feeling, when you are rushing down from the top of the mountain on a very high speed. And adrenaline is pulsating in your veins, incredible, awesome!!!
You should really try it!) But first practice. Sometimes it's dangerous...
Good luck!

Wolves replied on 22 December, 2016 - 16:56 Italy    In my opinion, the message brought to us by this tale has to do with the remarkable children immagination. That one which is lacking of obstacles -such as the fear of judgment , or failure-  that usually prevent adults acting creative deeds! I am not speaking about that kind of immagination that we use to call fancy,  although i refer to the capability by which we can  rethink the world that surraunds us, so as to change it! In the case of this short story, it refers to Afel's persistence of being an olympic skier although the place where he lives. , despite adult's opinions about the Afel "foolish" idea. However,  we should not forget about our occasional powerlessness, owed to the fisic environment, or to the social one, which do not permit to do or realize averything we would like to.

 
maithem replied on 23 May, 2016 - 19:30 Iraq    Hi everybody! Thanks a lot for this useful drill. Iam wondering why it said wrong about the sentence**the skiers wear unusual shoes**
It is said on the audio "the skiers wear strange shoes". .

 
Kirk replied on 24 May, 2016 - 07:09 Spain    Hello maithem,The story says:And on their feet, they had things that looked like strange shoes.“What are those?” he asked his uncle excitedly.
“Skis,” replied his uncle ...This means that Afel at first thought that the skis were shoes, but, as his uncle explains to him, they are actually skis (not shoes). That is why the correct answer to the True or false question is 'False'.All the best,
Kirk
